# SWADE Item Tables

SWADE Item Tables is a module for Foundry VTT that presents Items (e.g., Edges, Hindrances, skills, powers, equipment, et al) in a table format similar to tables presented in the Savage Worlds rulebooks. Items can be opened directly from the sheet for viewing and dragged from the table directly to the Actor's sheet.

GMs can configure settings to select which Items are included in the tables, including the ability to select entire collections of Items by source module.
