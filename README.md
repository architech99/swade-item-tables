# SWADE Item Tables

SWADE Item Tables is a module for Foundry VTT that presents Items (e.g., Edges, Hindrances, skills, powers, equipment, et al) in a table format similar to tables presented in the Savage Worlds rulebooks. Items can be opened directly from the sheet for viewing and dragged from the table directly to the Actor's sheet.

GMs can configure settings to select which Items are included in the tables, including the ability to select entire collections of Items by source module.

## Instructions

### Settings

#### Choosing Items to Include

- The module settings allow you to select which Items from which packages will appear in the table. Items from the World are also included.

- Right-clicking on an Item will render the Item's sheet.

#### Excluding Basic System Items

- The SWADE system for Foundry VTT comes with placeholder Items from the *Savage Worlds Adventure Edition* core rules that contain only page references. An option is available to omit those Items from the configuration and the tables.

### Viewing Item Tables

- The module includes a Macro to open a Form Application that displays the tables of Items. Simply execute the Macro to pull up the customized custom list.

- You can click on Items to view them, or drag them to Actor sheets.
